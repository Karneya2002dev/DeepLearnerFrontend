    "overview": "Python Full Stack Development involves building both the front-end (user interface) and back-end (server-side logic) of web applications. On the back-end, developers use Python frameworks like Django or Flask with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB. For the front-end, technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern libraries such as React.js or Angular are used. It covers API development, authentication, and integration of services to create scalable applications. Full stack developers manage deployment, debugging, and version control using tools like Git and Docker. This role demands knowledge of the entire software development lifecycle. Ultimately, it enables professionals to design complete, end-to-end solutions for real-world projects."

    "overview": "MERN Stack Development is a popular full stack JavaScript-based approach for building modern web applications. It combines MongoDB (database), Express.js (backend framework), React.js (frontend library), and Node.js (runtime environment). MERN allows developers to use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side programming, making development faster and more efficient. The stack supports building dynamic single-page applications (SPAs) with responsive UIs and scalable backends. It is widely used for developing real-time applications like eCommerce platforms, social media apps, and dashboards. MERN developers also handle API integration, authentication, and deployment on cloud platforms. This stack is highly preferred for its speed, flexibility, and seamless integration across all components."
